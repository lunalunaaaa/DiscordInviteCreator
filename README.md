# DiscordInviteCreator
Creates permanent invites to all of your discord servers, and saves them for a file, for easy backup.

!!!WARNING!!!
Doing any mass automated requests on discord using your user account *can* be risky,
You *could* get your account banned for using this, so I've added a 3 second wait per invite it creates.
It *should* be safe to use, but I'm just warning you.
I personally ran this on my main account, with 99 servers, and I'm fine, so you should be too.

Simply open the program and enter your discord token, and it will output a txt file to the directory with a list of server invites.
It will create each one automatically and set it to be a permanant invite.


Thanks to Goat#8814 for the idea to make this.
