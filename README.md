# DiscordInviteCreator
Creates permanent invites to all of your discord servers, and saves them for a file, for easy backup.

!!!WARNING!!!
Doing any mass automated requests on discord using your user account *can* be risky,
You *could* get your account banned for using this, so I've added a 3 second wait per invite it creates.
It *should* be safe to use, but I'm just warning you.

Simply open the program and enter your discord token, and it will output a txt file to the directory with a list of server invites.
It will create each one automatically and set it to be a permanant invite.
